## Dietician
A game which teaches the importance of taking appropriate nutrition and that helps you to maintain proper diet. A gamified experience to teach you the nutrition value of food.

## Inspiration
In the modern era, obesity and diet-related health issues are becoming prominent problems. One possible reason is that people don't know how to manage their diet evenly to absorb the nutrition that is needed for their bodies. It is especially being observed in kids as they are mostly addicted to fatty-diets or fast foods.

## What it does
The solution that we came out with is to improve people's consciousness of food and its nutrition by telling them which food contains which nutrition through an interactive game and gamified experience.
A game which teaches the importance of taking appropriate nutrition and that helps you to maintain proper diet. Even kids and adults can play this game and learn more about food nutrition.

## Game rules
1. At the start, select a specific nutrient that you are interested in.
2. Move the character to eat the food that contains the chosen nutrient.
3. The scores depend on how much the chosen nutrient each food contains.
4. Each food (except for water) will increase the character's satisfaction level.
5. User's hydration level decreases by time. Drinking water will increase the hydration level.
6. The game ends when either user's satiation level is full or hydration level is 0.
7. Leaderboard will be displayed at the end to compete the users to maintain proper diet.

## How we built it
We this entire game using pygame Python package. A package that eases the hard programming to developers to build the games faster.

## Challenges we ran into
1. We are new to pygame package, hence we initially struggled to understand in and out of the package to build our idea of game.
2. We had to try many trail and error methods to develop entire game.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. Building a gamified experience game that not only teaches the food nutrition and also makes us maintain health diet.
2. To help kids gain knowledge of healthy diet.

## What we learned
1. We learnt about pygame package.

## What's next for Dietician
1. Currently, there is a limit on the amount of food and nutrition that we have implemented. Expand the same leveraging other foods nutrition values and include them in the game.
2.  Provide more levels like Basic, Intermediate, Advanced options in the game.
3. Make platform independent to provide to Android apps, Windows and convert this game into executable apps.

## Game setup and installation:
1. Git clone the repo
2. Create Python Venv
3. Install requirements.txt
4. Run python play.py and enjoy the game.
